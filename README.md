# Beach Ball

Welcome to **Beach Ball**! üå¥üèñÔ∏è

Beach Ball is my fun, beach-themed twist on the classic Crash Ball game from Crash Bash. I'm working on it from scratch to practice my generalist, coding, and technical art skills. It's a labor I work on during my free time, and I can't wait to share it with you!

## Play Test [HERE](https://ngelsp.itch.io/beach-ball)

Curious to see what Beach Ball is all about? You can play test the current version of the game [here](https://ngelsp.itch.io/beach-ball). Keep in mind, it's still a work in progress, so your feedback would be super helpful!

## What's Inside?

- **Beach Vibes:** Fun and sunny beach environment with lifesavers playing against each other hitting coconuts and cannonballs (cannonballs are not there yet lol).
- **Power-Ups:** There are power-ups, but they're still not visible due to missing visuals and FX. However, they are working!
- **Original Art:** Every piece of art is handmade by me to give you that perfect beach feel.
- **Powered by Unity:** Built with Unity.
- **Trained AI Opponents:** For now, you're playing against a trained AI using machine learning agents.
- **WIP Elements:** It is still a work in progress, so expect some bugs and unfinished visuals on some elements.

## Controls

- **Move Left and Right:** A and D
- **Sprint:** Shift
- **Grab Ball:** Spacebar
